# Development guidelines.

## API and Admin

Welcome to the development guidelines for the [project name] Admin and API. Please make sure to read and understand the document.

In order to have a high quality product, the following rules will be checked in every PR and contribution.

- **Code Styling:** PSR2 should be fully implemented, code with irregular indentation will not be accepted, as well as all of the rules described [here](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), this will be enforced using [PHP CS](https://cs.symfony.com/), to run the linter use the command `composer cs` and it should fix all the CS issues before sending a PR.
- **Nova Components:** For anything that can't be done with Laravel Nova out of the box, we well leverage nova components, this components will be build according to our needs and will leverage existing Vue JS and laravel components the most. **Any package to be added will be evaluated prior to accepting it in the PR**

Avoid using repository pattern or service classes, it does not go well with Active Record and it is unnecessary. Apply the following rules if you need to extend or create custom logic.

- **Side Effects:** For anything that should happen Before creating, updating, deleting a model you should create [observers](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent#observers) or use [model events](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent#events).
- **Validation:** For any validation that needs to be performed in the requests, make sure to use [Laravel's built in validation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/validation) and its [available rules](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/validation#available-validation-rules) and if there are not rules that fits your use case, create a [custom rule](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/validation#custom-validation-rules) instead of doing any manual ifs and validations in the controller / mutation.

Other rules to keep in mind.

- **File Uploads:** For every file upload the s3 disk should be used without custom implementations, the s3 disk should be used as default except for tests, [storing files](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/filesystem#storing-files) is the way to upload files. To retrieve them use the [get](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/filesystem#retrieving-files) method of the filesystem laravel provides. For files that need to be accessible publicly a temporarily url should be given in the API using the [temporary URLs](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/filesystem#file-urls)
- **Authentication:** There is already an authentication implementation provided using [Lighthouse Passport Auth](https://github.com/joselfonseca/lighthouse-graphql-passport-auth) for more information on how it was implemented read [this blog post](https://ditecnologia.com/2019/06/24/graphql-auth-with-passport-and-lighthouse-php/)


## Nova Admin Panel

Nova is an admin panel solution provided by the Laravel core team and some contributors. It allows us to build admin interfaces based on code configuration and vue components. Please keep in mind

- **Do not edit nova source:** For convenience and not giving out credentials for laravel nova licenses, we have installed nova as a composer path repository which means there is a nova directory with all of the source code. This does not mean we should modify any file in this directory as they are treated as vendor dependencies. Please see the [nova documentation](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/2.0/installation.html).
- **Leverage Laravel models for custom logic:** Nova uses the models to create the records, all of the side effects that are needed when creating a record can be attached to the model with model events and observers. In the API do not create custom logic as it will have to be re implemented in the admin panel.

## Non blocking tasks

A common practice is to send emails or do tasks that require long execution time in the background using [Queues](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/queues). This queues have to be executed and monitored by [Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/horizon) which is already set up and configured in the scaffold, all outgoing mails should also be [queued](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/mail#queueing-mail) and each outgoing mail should be in it's own queue job, meaning a single queue job should not send more than one email.

## Testing

- Unit and feature test MUST be created for each feature that requires more than a CRUD or any side effect. The PR that does not contain a unit or feature test will not be considered and the feature will be mark as not implemented even if the code is in the PR. Testing with Laravel is TOO easy to skip it. [See the docs](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/testing). 
- Use Fakes instead of mocking services for the tests, this means a contract and 2 implementations **MUST** be created for each service we will integrate with. For example:
    
    To make requests to Elastic Search API we will need the following classes
        
        - ElasticSearchGatewayContract.php: This should be the contract or interface that defines all the methods the gateway needs to implement.
        - ElasticSearchGateway.php: This will be the actual implementation of the contract, you may use guzzle as http client to implement all of the neccesary methods
        - FakeElasticSearchGateway: This will be the fake used in the tests, meaning we will not query ES but we will simulate the responses for the happy and not happy paths.
    
    This will be bind using the [service container](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/container) in the [service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/6.0/providers).
      
- Use [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) to develop the features. in Laravel is really easy to accomplish

## Frontend React 

### `npm run lint`

This command runs the linter that is installed in the application. `Eslint` is the current linter that is being used.
If any lint errors exist you will see an output after running this command.
```
> eslint .


/Users/stevenjimenez/workspace/dnt-web-react_grapqhl_app_scaffold/src/components/account/index.js
  7:7  error  Identifier 'something_here' is not in camel case     camelcase
  7:7  error  'something_here' is assigned a value but never used  no-unused-vars

âœ– 2 problems (2 errors, 0 warnings)
```

 The Configuration and rules that Eslint follows can be found in `.eslintrc.json`. Rules are extended from Airbnb's style guide with a few customization or modification of some rules.

 For more information in regards to how Eslint was added to the scaffold,see the following resources:

 - https://georgespake.com/blog/eslint/

### Leverage these

#### tailwind (utility first css)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).

#### PostCSS plugins

These plugins will work similar to how SASS works without the need of sass, we decided to go postcss since is recomended to have everything in one place, also please Leverage these.

- [postcss-import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import).
- [postcss-nested](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-nested).
- [postcss-simple-vars](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-simple-vars).

#### Importing assets
Import assets using `import` inside our components.
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import atYankeeStadium from 'assets/png/at-yankee-stadium.png';

const TopAppBar = () => (
  <header>
    <img src={atYankeeStadium} alt="at yankee stadium" className="w-64" />
  </header>
);

export default withRouter( TopAppBar );
```
